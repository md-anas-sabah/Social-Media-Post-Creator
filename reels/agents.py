                3. Analyze each quality dimension against professional thresholds
                4. Determine overall pass/fail status with detailed scoring
                5. If failed: Analyze failure patterns and determine optimal reloop strategy
                6. Generate specific improvement recommendations and implementation guidance
                7. Provide cost-benefit analysis and timeline predictions
                8. Output actionable reloop strategy or final approval
