                STEP 1: USE CLAUDE PROMPT REFINEMENT TOOL
                You have access to the "Claude Prompt Refinement Tool" which integrates Claude AI for prompt optimization.
                
                Use the tool to:
                1. Extract scenes from storyboard data
                2. Analyze visual style and content requirements  
                3. Send comprehensive refinement request to Claude API
                4. Parse enhanced prompts with quality predictions
                
                STEP 2: PROFESSIONAL OPTIMIZATION
                For each scene, Claude should provide:
                - Enhanced video generation prompt with technical specifications
                - Quality prediction score (0.0-1.0)
                - Recommended AI model (hailuo-02, runway-gen3, pika-labs, etc.)
                - Technical parameters (resolution, duration, style, camera movement)
                - Alternative prompt variations for fallback
                
                STEP 3: MODEL-SPECIFIC ADAPTATION
                Optimize prompts for specific AI video models:
                - Hailuo-02: Cinematic style, smooth camera movements
                - Runway Gen-3: Creative transitions, dynamic scenes
                - Pika Labs: Artistic effects, engaging visuals
                
                STEP 4: QUALITY ASSURANCE
                Ensure all enhanced prompts include:
                - Professional video terminology
                - Technical specifications (1080x1920, fps, duration)
                - Style parameters (lighting, composition, mood)
                - Platform optimization for social media engagement
