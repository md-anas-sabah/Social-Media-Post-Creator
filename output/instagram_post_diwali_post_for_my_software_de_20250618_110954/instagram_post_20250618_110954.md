## Timing & Strategy
Best posting times for Instagram are 6:00 PM - 9:00 PM on weekdays and 10:00 AM - 1:00 PM on weekends. It's essential to consider these peak times for optimal engagement. Additionally, it's recommended to schedule posts during these time frames to reach a larger audience. Audience timezone considerations should also be taken into account to ensure posts are seen by the target audience when they are most active. Platform-specific tip: Utilize Instagram Stories and Reels during peak hours to increase visibility and engagement.
